SCENARIO_2_FINAL_ANSWER = """
None of the known venues meet the capacity and dietary requirements. The Albanach, The Haymarket Vaults, and The Guilford Arms have a capacity of 180, 160, and 200 respectively, which is less than the required capacity of 300. The Bow Bar has a capacity of 80, which is also less than the required capacity, and it is currently full. Therefore, none of the known venues can accommodate 300 people with vegan options.

Your input is lacking necessary details. Please provide more information or specify the task you need help with.

# Would this behaviour be acceptable in a real booking assistant? Min 30 words.
SCENARIO_3_ACCEPTABLE = """
The agent correctly identified that the question is out of scope and communicated it, but the manner
of communication could be improved. In a real booking assistant, it would be
better to reiterate what the booking assistant can help with, rather than just stating that the input is lacking details. 
For example, the agent could say, "I can assist you with booking a venue in Edinburgh. 
Please provide details such as the number of guests, dietary requirements, and preferred date." 
This would guide the user towards providing the necessary information for the agent to be helpful.

# Compare the LangGraph graph to exercise3_rasa/data/rules.yml. Min 30 words.
TASK_D_COMPARISON = """
Rasa flowchart describes a much more deterministic flow of the conversation,
whereas the LangGraph graph represents a more flexible and dynamic interaction between the agent and the tools.
This is a trade off between flexibility (current implementation in langgraph) and control (Rasa rules). 
It is worth mentioning that langgraph framework allows building much more deterministic flows rather than
just simple ReAct agent as in this example.
